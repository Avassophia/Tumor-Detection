# Tumor-Detection
In this project, we implement Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch to classify tumor data. We will also perform cross-validation to tune our hyperparameters. We have two goals - first, we wish to evaluate the quality of our classification model using metrics such as accuracy recall, and F1 score. Finally, we conduct a thorough analysis of our model's strengths and limitations.
## Dataset

Uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, focusing on features like radius, perimeter, and concave points.

## How to Run

- Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the badge below.
- Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
- No special setup or installation needed.

## Results

Final model achieved approximately 95% accuracy and 91% recall on the test set.
