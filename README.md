# Tumor-Detection
In this project, we implement Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch to classify tumor data. We will also perform cross-validation to tune our hyperparameters. We have two goals - first, we wish to evaluate the quality of our classification model using metrics such as accuracy recall, and F1 score. Finally, we conduct a thorough analysis of our model's strengths and limitations.
